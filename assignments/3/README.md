# Assignment 3


## Part 1

Contains serial computation code

## Part 2

Contains the parallel computation code

## Part 3

Contains graphing code

My strong speedup graph looks like trash. I assume this is because of the different runs using different amounts of nodes so communication time varies significantly. (The first few runs are on 1 node so communication time is very small.)

I also assume that the speedup would be better if the matrix was bigger.
